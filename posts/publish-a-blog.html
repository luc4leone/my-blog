        <h1>A Blog Simple to Build</h1>
        <p>8 april 2023</p>
        <h3>Summary ‚è±Ô∏è</h3>
        <p class="summary italic">
            There is almost always a simple solution. The solution to the heart
            of the problem. Where nothing is superfluous. Difficult is not to
            listen to the little voice inside me that says "add this." Hard is
            to ignore the others, the adders, and trust the subtraction way.
        </p>

        <p>
            I wake up and think: "I want to create a UI design course, to share
            a secret: to design a good UI, you have to be a little more of a
            programmer and a little less of a graphic designer".
        </p>

        <p>
            "Maybe it's better to start with a blog," I say to myself, "easier
            than a course." Post after post, I'll try to explain what I mean.
        </p>

        <p>
            I don't want to blog using platforms, I want control over my content
            and the publishing process. And then I say to myself, "It can't be
            that complicated to set up a blog". Given this self-imposed
            constraint, I decide that I want to build the simplest blog in the
            world.
        </p>

        <p>
            A post is an HTML page, so I create my-first-post.html file. I also
            create a repo on Github, which allows me to publish a static site
            with a couple of clicks.
        </p>

        <p>
            I get into it, I buy a domain, leone.blog, and point it to Github
            servers. So now the blog has my name. The page is on the web in a
            few minutes: I've created the blog!
        </p>
        <p>
            I should end it here, but I can't accept that people can't comment
            on a post and be notified if a new post comes out. It seems
            inevitable that I have to add a couple of forms, write some
            javascript, and add a database. Too much work, my laziness rebels.
            "Be lazy!" I say to myself.
        </p>
        <p>I think about it and add two paragraphs:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>"Do you want to comment? Send me an email"</li>
            <li>
                "Do you want to receive an email when I publish the next post?
                Send me an email"
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tomorrow maybe I'll add the forms, but for now, I feel brutal.</p>

        <p>
            The gist of this post is not to explain how to create the world's
            simplest blog in 10 minutes, but to confess that it took me a long
            time to understand that there is almost always a simple and quick
            solution. Simple, but not easy, because it's not easy to have the
            courage to remove what is not essential. Yes, it takes courage not
            to do what everyone else does, to add things that are of little use,
            making what could be simple, complex.
