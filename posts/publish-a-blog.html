        <h1>A Simple Blog to Build</h1>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p class="summary">
            Software: there is almost always a simple solution. The solution to
            the problem's core. Where nothing is superfluous. It's difficult not
            to listen to the little voice inside me that says "add this". It's
            difficult to ignore the majority, the adders, and have faith that
            they are wrong.
        </p>

            This morning I wake up and think: "I want to create a UI design
            course, to share a secret: to design a good UI, you have to be a
            little more of a programmer and a little less of a designer".
        </p>

        <p>
            "Maybe it's better to start with a blog," I say to myself, "easier
            than a course." Post after post, I'll try to explain what I mean.
        </p>

        <p>
            I don't want to publish the blog using platforms, I want control
            over my content and the publishing process. And then I say to
            myself, "it can't be that complicated to set up a blog." Given this
            self-imposed constraint, I decide that I want to build the simplest
            blog in the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            A post is an HTML page, so I create my-first-post.html file. I also
            create a repo on Github, so I have two copies of the file. Github
            allows me to publish a static site with a couple of clicks.
        </p>

        <p>
            I get into it, I buy a domain, leone.blog, and point it to Github
            servers. So now the blog has my name. The page is on the web and in
            a few minutes, I've created the blog!
        </p>
        <p>
            I should stop here, but I can't accept that people can't comment on
            a post and receive a notification if a new post comes out. It seems
            inevitable that I have to add a couple of forms, write some
            javascript, and add a database. Too much work, my laziness rebels.
            "Be lazy!" I say to myself.
        </p>
        <p>I think about it and add two paragraphs:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>"Do you want to comment? Send me an email"</li>
            <li>
                "Do you want to receive an email when I publish the next post?
                Send me an email"
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tomorrow maybe I'll add the forms, but for now, I feel brutal.</p>

        <p>
            The essence of this post is not to explain how to create the
            simplest blog in the world in 10 minutes, but to confess that it
            took me a long time to understand that there is almost always a
            simple and quick solution. Simple, but not easy, because it's not
            easy to have the courage to remove what is not essential. Yes, it
            takes courage not to do what everyone else is doing, adding things
            that are of little use, making what could be simple, complex.
