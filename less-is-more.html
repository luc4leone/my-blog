<h1>Considering the subtraction option</h1>

<p>Less can be more… sometimes, but not always (1). “Less is more” is also not actionable advice I can test. It’s more of an insight, to ponder. </p>

<p>Considering to subtract - a functionality, an element - from the user interface is an option that I usually overlook.
The natural option for me is to add something. Cutting is less natural. The problem is that it can be <strong>the best</strong> option.
It’s not only me. It’s a human thing: we neglect subtraction as a way to change things (2). We systematically tend to overlook possibilities, that sometimes would lead to better solutions.
So it’s important to keep in mind that we have that option.
Since I have discovered this &quot;blindness&quot;, I have tried to be aware of it in my approach to solve problems. Not only UI problems, since it is true in general. And it's actionable: when facing a problem, ask yourself: &quot;Can I solve it by subtraction?&quot;.</p>
